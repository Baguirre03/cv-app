First project with react **wooooo**! This one was a lot of fun, a little confusing at first but once I got used to it, it become _way_ more enjoyable. A lot of organizing my code and components here while learning new concepts like passing up state was super interesting. Love seeing the way that react can already make things more _reactive_. Overall exciting to learn more, and was suepr tempted to keep adding to this project.

### Objectives

- [x] Create new react project
- [x] Plan with the `plan.md` within the file
- [x] Begin making components and organizing the code
- [x] Begin combining components
- [x] Figure out wher eto pass in and keep track of `state` then make sure that state is correctly updated/is correlate dwith correct components
- [x] Finalize project and style with animations

### What I learned and What I would do differently

#### Learned:

- Basics of react!! Super happy to learn this and excited to learn more
- `State` and `Props`
- Orginization of components

#### Differently:

- Overall happy with how I approahced and did this project. Learned alot as I went on, but still happy with how I planed.
